Trying to develop a tracking file for the orders

For now the plan is for the receiving side.


Any Suggestions or help will be appreciatable 

I am learning only sum of the basics formula.
As I don't have the knowledge I am taking more
time. 

Even though the sheet need to design such a way
That all data entered will not loose and it will
Not affect the efficiency.

1---> So the plan is **all the product and info for a
'value A3' will be displayed when the data 
filled to'Value A3'**. There I am facing an issue 
that some orders may be ** multiple value, it 
will over writes the value or formula in the 
nearby cell**. By showing error message

2--->> Then I want to know after this when someone enters 
any data in that sheet is there any way to get the 
name and time when the data were 
Entered.

3--->> And the last plan is to transfer all values to 
Another sheet like a ""SAVE BUTTON"" works.
By creating a cell, After all data is entered and
By clicking on the Cell all data values will be 
Transfered as no one can edit after that 


If anyone have any idea,suggestion and any modification
Regarding this plan, please share with me I can
 share the link if anyone needs. And it will be a
big help for me



THANKS IN ADVANCE
